## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a little bit about CSS media queries, which are usefull for beginner responsive websites.
I algo used flex-direction in order to display the elements depending on the screen size. And object-fit to 
place correctly the perfume image.


### Continued development

I would like to learn more about responsive web design using flexbox or grid.


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This helped me to understand how CSS media queries work.
- [Resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34247337/object-fit-not-affecting-images) - I was having issues while placing my img since I didn't know it was necessary to define img width in order to use object-fit property.
